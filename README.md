## Hi there 👋

I’m Juanita! I’m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz and the Community Manager for the Scientific Python Project.

- 🎓 I completed my undergrad in pure mathematics at Universidad Javeriana in Colombia.
- 👩‍💻 I was a developer for Spyder IDE at Quansight which is when I started actively contributing to open source and became a huge open source advocate.
- 🌱 I’m currently a community manager for the Scientific Python Project, helping grow and coordinate the scientific Python ecosystem.
- 📢 I’m part of the SciPy organizing committee as a Communications Chair, helping with outreach and engagement for the conference.
- 🔐 I do research in open source security in collaboration with the Open Source Program Office at UCSC.
- 🎶 I'm a singer, and I play some piano and guitar. I've been in multiple bands, choirs and music groups.
