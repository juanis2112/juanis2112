## Hi there 👋

I’m Juanita! I’m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz and the Community Manager for the Scientific Python Project.

- 🎓 I completed my undergrad in pure mathematics at Universidad Javeriana in Colombia.
- 👩‍💻 I was a developer for [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org) at Quansight which is when I started actively contributing to open source and became a huge open source advocate.
- 🌱 I’m currently a community manager for the [Scientific Python Project](https://scientific-python.org), helping grow and coordinate the scientific Python ecosystem.
- 📢 I’m part of the [SciPy Conference](https://www.scipy2025.scipy.org) organizing committee as a Communications Chair, helping with outreach and engagement for the conference.
- 🔐 I do research in open source security in collaboration with the [Open Source Program Office at UCSC](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io).
- 🎶 I'm a singer, and I play some piano and guitar. I've been in multiple bands, choirs and music groups.
